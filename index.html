          <h1>Endless Ending</h1>
          <p>We must encounter some events or stressful moments, which drive us to be panic, overwhelming, pessimistic etc. Trapped in negative emotions always seems like endless, 
            and the realization of the endless ending of negative emotions are always beyond hope. It's near to finals, the end of a semester. I hope this little game can give you a source of hope,
            warmth, or even nothing (but will not trigger your negative feelings). Making this game is like a conversation with myself as well, finding out the reason that causes me to be distracted unresonably, 
            endlessly, and unhappily. If most objects and events that we meet in our life have endless endings, and if we have strength to keep positivity, why don't we make positivity have its endless ending?
            Hope you like this game. Enjoy!
          </p>
